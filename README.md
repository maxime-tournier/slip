# what

simple prototype language with:

- s-expressions based syntax
- hindley-milner-based type system
- row polymorphism (scoped labels)
- (open) sum types + pattern matching
- first-class polymorphism with type inference
- higher-kinded types
- minimal package imports
- cryptic error messages :-/
- minimal interpreter

## how

1. vanilla hindley-milner
2. row polymorphism *à la* [Leijen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/extensible-records-with-scoped-labels/), with both records and sums
3. first-class polymorphism *à
  la* [Jones](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/fcp.html) *i.e.* function
  variables introduce FCP + give up first-class data constructors. the only data
  constructors are module constructors
4. parametrized signatures also *à
  la* [Jones](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/paramsig.html), with
  universal quantifiers only
5. type/module/value language *à
  la* [Rossberg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/1ml/), but trying hard to
  stick to rank-1 types (and use FCP when necessary)

1, 2 are pretty standard. 3 is implemented using modules as the only data
constructors, which validate records (soon: sums too) against their signature
(4). For instance:

```elisp
(new functor
   (map list-map))
```

This boxes the record type `forall a, b, f. {map: (a -> b) -> (f a) -> (f b)}`
in module type `forall f. functor f`. Module signatures are associated to module
type constructors (here `functor`) and are used to unbox module values, as for
instance:

`forall a, b, f. (functor f) -> {map: (a -> b) -> (f a) -> (f b)}`

5 is used because I am lazy and did not want to implement a separate language
for types and terms, so I tried to use the term language as much as
possible.

```elisp
(def (list-size (list x))
     (match x
            (nil _ 0)
            (cons self (+ 1 (list-size self.tail)))))
```

In this example, `list` is actually a value:

```elisp
list
;; list : (type 'a) -> type (list 'a) = #<fun>
```

The right-most `list` is the *type* constructor `list`, which is here reified as
the *value* `list`. This *value* is used for function parameter type
annotations. The *type* constructor `list` is associated with the following
signature:

`forall a. (list a) -> <cons: {head: a; tail: list a}; nil: list a>`

which makes it possible to automatically unbox values of type `list a` in
function applications, in this case for pattern matching.

## why

- to discover/understand how functional languages work
  
- to have a simple basis for trying out advanced features like lifetime
  polymorphism, linear type systems, etc

- for the fun!!1

## example 

```elisp
;; no "hello word (yet) sorry :/"

;; simple arithmetic
(+ 1 2)
;; : integer = 3


;; empty list
nil
;; nil : list 'a = ()


;; list concatenation, pattern matching
(def (concat lhs rhs)
     (match lhs
            (cons self (cons self.head (concat self.tail rhs)))
            (nil _ rhs)))
concat
;; concat : <cons: {head: 'a; ...b}; nil: 'c> -> (list 'a) -> list 'a = #<fun>


;; build a list containing an integer range
(def (range start end)
     (if (= start end) nil
       (cons start (range (+ start 1) end))))
range
;; range : integer -> integer -> list integer = #<fun>


;; some test list
(def data (concat (range 0 10) (range 0 3)))
data
;; data : list integer = (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2)


;; list map
(def (list-map f (list x))
     (match x
            (nil _ nil)
            (cons self (cons (f self.head) (list-map f self.tail)))))
list-map
;; list-map : ('a -> 'b) -> (list 'a) -> list 'b = #<fun>


;; doubling our test list
(list-map (fn (x) (* 2 x)) data)


;; functor module definition
(module (functor (ctor f))

(def (maybe-map f (maybe a))
     (match a
            (none _ none)
            (some self (just (f self)))))

        (>>= (fn (a b) ((m a) -> (a -> (m b)) -> (m b)))))

;; maybe-bind : (maybe 'a) -> ('a -> maybe 'b) -> maybe 'b = #<fun>


;; maybe monad instance
(def maybe-monad
     (new monad
          (pure just)
          (>>= maybe-bind)))

;; reader pure

          (>>= reader-bind)))

;; reader-monad : monad 'a -> = {>>=: #<fun>; pure: #<fun>}
```

## TODO

- improve error messages
- do notation
- state monad, mutable refs, etc
